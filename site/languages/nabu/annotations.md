Nabu supports normal, marker, and single-element annotations, arrays, nested annotations, and default values.

```java
@Deprecated(since = "1.5")
public class SomeClass {

    @Deprecated
    @Override
    fun clear(): void {
    }
}
```

Annotation retention and target are emitted via `AsmByteCodeEmitter.emitAnnotations`.

Annotation interfaces themselves can also be declared in Nabu. The compiler also has deep support for running JSR-269-style annotation processors — see [Annotation Processing](/annotation-processing/).
